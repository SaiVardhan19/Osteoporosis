# Osteoporosis Detection Using Neural Networks

Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become more porous and less dense than healthy bones. This makes bones thin and weak, increasing the risk of fractures. The most vulnerable areas are the wrists, hips, and spine. Osteoporosis itself, in the absence of a fracture, causes no symptoms, and most people with the disease are unaware of their condition until they break a bone or take a bone density test. Osteoporosis affects more women than men. Aging is the most common risk factor. Other contributing factors to osteoporosis include smoking, heavy alcohol use, family history of the disease, and chronic diseases of the kidneys, lungs, stomach, or intestines.

In this repository, we implement a simple neural network to predict whether a patient is suffering from osteoporosis, along with the probability of the prediction being correct.

## **This code is categorized into five parts:**

### **1. Importing the Necessary Libraries**
This includes libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, **sklearn**, **TensorFlow**, and their subsidiaries. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
This step involves the following sub-tasks:
- **Loading the Data**: Importing the dataset from a CSV or other data source.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing missing values using median values to ensure no data loss.
- **Encoding Features**: Converting categorical features into numerical form, such as encoding 'Gender' as 1 (Male) and 2 (Female).
- **Selecting the Target and Features**: Separating the input features (X) and the target variable (y).
- **Splitting the Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets (80:20 split) to ensure unbiased evaluation.
- **Scaling the Data**: Normalizing the feature values using **StandardScaler** to achieve faster convergence of the model.

### **3. Model Compilation and K-Fold Validation**
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Using K-Fold from sklearn.model_selection to split the data into 3 folds with shuffling enabled.
- **Model Structure**: 
  - **Input Layer**: 128 input features.
  - **Hidden Layers**: 64 and 32 neurons, using ReLU activation.
  - **Batch Normalization**: Normalizing layer outputs to reduce internal covariate shift.
  - **Dropout**: Regularization method to prevent overfitting.
  - **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with a **sigmoid** activation function for binary classification (osteoporosis or no osteoporosis).
- **Early Stopping**: Stops training when model performance no longer improves.
- **Compilation**: Using the **Adam optimizer** and **binary crossentropy** as the loss function with accuracy as the metric.
- **Training**: Training the model for 100 epochs with a batch size of 16, while monitoring the validation loss.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
In this step, we evaluate the model's performance on the test set:
- **Prediction**: The model returns a Boolean output which is converted to an integer (0 or 1) for evaluation.
- **Metrics**: Performance is measured using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **5. New Patient Prediction**
This section provides functionality to predict osteoporosis for a new patient:
- **get_patient()**: Collects patient data while ensuring inputs are valid.
- **predict_new()**: Uses the trained model to predict if the patient is at risk of osteoporosis. The function takes a patientâ€™s data as input and returns the prediction (0 = No Osteoporosis, 1 = Osteoporosis).

This structured approach enables clear understanding, efficient development, and ensures maintainability of the project.

## **Conclusion**
The implementation of an osteoporosis detection system using neural networks provides a valuable tool for early diagnosis and prevention. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this system can assist healthcare professionals in making timely decisions. The use of K-fold cross-validation, batch normalization, dropout, and early stopping ensures model robustness, generalizability, and reduced overfitting. With further data collection and fine-tuning, this model can achieve higher accuracy and become a more effective aid in medical diagnosis. Continuous improvements, such as incorporating more patient data and exploring advanced neural network architectures, can further enhance the system's predictive performance.
